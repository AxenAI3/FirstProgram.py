# FirstProgram.py
My first Python program ‚Äì learning print, variables, and output basics.
Print("Hello World")
Here is print is the name of function in python, This command print the word on the screen and this is called output.

Variable=Value
Here is the "(=)" sign is called is Assignment Operator.
Name="Axen AI"
year="2025"

Here it is printing the variavle not the value, beacuse we are using ("") this.
Print("Name")
It will print "Name"
Print("year")
it will print "year"

Here we will not use (""), to get the value not the variable.
print(Name)
it will print "Axen AI"
print(year)
it will print "2025"

If you want to type it in a sentence formate,
then type:
Print("My Comapany name is:",Name)
It will print "My Comapany name is: Axen AI"
Print("Started in:",year)
It will print "Started in: 2025"

Learning one line at a time, and loving the process!
If you‚Äôre also starting with Python, let‚Äôs connect and grow together. ü§ù
